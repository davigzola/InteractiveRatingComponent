## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I tested my skills using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and discovered that I have too much to improve.

### Continued development

In my next project I will improve my learnings about responsiveness. I think that I want to be better at positioning elements on the screen so I need to learn about Flexbox and Grid Skills.
